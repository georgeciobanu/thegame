To get the source code:
git clone git@github.com:georgeciobanu/thegame.git

There are two folders: 
magical (this is the Rails backend) and 
DoMinions - this is the XCode project (frontend)
The dotcloud.yml file is there for when we have to deploy - feel free to install the DotCloud client: http://docs.dotcloud.com/firststeps/install/
Dotcloud credentials:
geo.ciobanu@gmail.com

For Rails:
rvm install 1.9.3-p125 --with-gcc=clang
rvm --default use 1.9.3-p125
gem uninstall rails
gem install rails

Then go to the 'magical' folder and run 
bundle install to install everything needed for Rails

For the frontend, install the latest version of XCode and then the iOS SDK. Latest should be fine.
