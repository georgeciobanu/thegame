<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%"> You are on team blue.</p>
<p>
  Click on one of the areas where you have minions to select it, and then on either <br>
  1. your team's area to move them OR <br>
  2. another team's area to attack it <br>
  See the JS console for debugging info.
</p>
<p> All attacks are hardcoded to succeed. (we are testing this game right now)
